1. How can I prepare for software engineering interviews at top tech companies?
A. Software Engineering interviews generally consist off 1-3 rounds on an average. The specificity of each round depends on the company. The most common methods are: CV grilling, testing DSA and basic CS-concepts such as OS, DBMS, Networks, etc. Make sure to be thorough with your CV as failing to answer anything from your CV will leave a bad impression. Start off with a good intro and add some projects you did in your intro so that you can lead the interviewer. Make sure to have an upper hand in leading the interview. Coming to technicalities, most interviews range for upto 40-60 minutes. Refer some important models of questions which the company asks in-general.SE interviews consist off interviewer testing your DSA skills. Don't rush to the solution, even if you solved it earlier. Start off with brute-force and explain your path to optimality. Keep asking the interviewer for more details regarding the question such as memory constraints, time constraints, etc. Once you have a solution, explain it to the interviewer. Make sure to explain the time and space complexity of your solution. If you have time, try to optimize your solution. If you can't, explain the interviewer that you can't and ask a question in your field of expertise. Make sure to have a good communication with the interviewer. If you are stuck, ask for hints. If you can't solve the problem, don't worry. The interviewer is more interested in your approach to the problem rather than the solution. Most companies do not ask you to hard-code the solution except some like Rakuten, etc. Final rounds include a HR round where your personality and behaviourial analysis is done. This is for testing your company fit. Go through the core values of the company and their motto.
2. What are the key differences between Phase 1 and Phase 2 of CDC placements?
A. Phase 1 of placements happen in December starting with exams from mid-Sep just before DP (Durga Puja) vacations. The day1 of placements is on Dec 1 always, no matter what. In recent times, there has been an emergence of a new idea of Day 0, where students appear for interview on Nov 30th late might to Dec 1 early morning, just to increase the statsitics for Day 1 which get published in News. Since it is a matter of prestige, Phase 1 includes total number of offers from Day 0 all the way till Day 21 or so, till phase 1 companies get exhausted. Phase 2 of placements happen in January after the winter vacations and usually after Convocation of the previous passed out batch. It extends all the way till Spring Sem, till the end semester exams are completed, at times even in the summer vacations.
3. How important are internships for securing a good placement offer?
A. Internships are nothing but, a brief period of industrial experience. It can include research projects or working in companies. While some profiles and roles leverage research projects, most of the roles, specicially traditional SDE roles can be bagged with necessary corporate experience. Interning at companies, guides you to solve problems and consult them in a professional and efficient way than bookish knowledge. It also helps you to understand the work culture, work-life balance and pressure handling during peak times. While all this stays true, it is not necessary to have internships to get a good placement offer. If you have a good CGPA, multiple PORs in KGP societies, or participation in online and offline hackathons, you can still get a good placement offer. Internships are just a way to get a headstart in the corporate world. They might help you to network well and build connections with the company. But, it is not necessary to have internships to get a good placement offer.On a scale of 1-10, I would rate internships as 7.5 in importance for securing a good placement offer.

11. What's the typical timeline for the CDC placement process?
A. CDC Placements set off with an official notice from the CDC on ERP noticeboard. The CDC committee organizes a presentation where they present the statistics related to placements such as percentage of unplaced students, number of offers, etc. CV Registration opens within a few days and lasts for upto three weeks before lcosing the portal after multiple deadline extensions. There is a brief gap afterwards, and the official tests and comapny PPT sessions usually set off after the Dusshera Holidays. Phase 1 of placements happen in December starting with exams from mid-Sep just before DP (Durga Puja) vacations. The day1 of placements is on Dec 1 always, no matter what. In recent times, there has been an emergence of a new idea of Day 0, where students appear for interview on Nov 30th late might to Dec 1 early morning, just to increase the statsitics for Day 1 which get published in News.

It extends all the way till Spring Sem, till the end semester exams are completed, at times even in the summer vacations.

15. What are the pros and cons of accepting a PPO (Pre-Placement Offer) versus sitting for placements?
A. The answer is relative. There might exist many scenarios, depending on whether you are a circuital or a non-circuital student. Circuital includes students from dpeartments (CS,MA,EC,EE,IE and IM) 1. If you are a circuital student, with CGPA 8+, good skills set and the PPO's CTC is less than 20LPA, you can reject PPO without any hesitation because therre are higher chances that you might bag a better package in CDC placements in Phase 1 itself. 2. If you are circuital student, with CGPA 7.5-8 while being eligible for most companies in CDC except a few quant companies, it is upto you. If you are confident about your worth, you might as well reject PPO and sit for placements. 3. If you are a non-circuital student, with CGPA less than 7.5, accepting PPO and trying for off-campus offers would be the best scenario because you can always drop the PPO once you get an-off campus offer. But, if you are willing to risk it and prove your skills, you are always open to reject PPO and try your best for on-campus placements, best of luck for that. For non-circuital students, the situation is always risky due to the bias existing for them in CDC. If the CTC is in the range of 25-30LPA, you might consider accepting the offer and peacing out autumn and spring sem. If you are too ambitious, you might try for off-campus offers and reject the PPO once you get an off-campus offer. If you are a non-circuital, with less than 20LPA CTC, your CGPA is very crucial. Consider the range of your CGPA, if you are atthi (8+ CGPA), or a nehli (9+) or a satti (7+) and take a decision accordingly. The answer is very dynamic and depends on the individual's situation. You might be a dual-degree student or a B.Tech UG in your final year, you might have other plans for Autumn sem, such as Inter IIT or working on something else. To conclude, CDC placements is a very tough game due to many internal biases and black-box shortlisting criteria. The average percentage of students getting placed in CDC placements varies year wise, with 2023-24 one of the worst years in terms of number of companies visiting due to fears of recession. Meanwhile accepting PPO does not mean you are entitled to pathway of success. It is just a way to secure your future and have a backup plan. Once you accept PPO from internships which you bagged from CDC, you are no longer allowed to sit for placements. Make the choice wisely. 
16. How can I transition from a core engineering background to a tech role during placements?
A. The answer depends on which year are you in. If you are a pre-final year student and have a good academic background (yk what I mean, high CGPA, more than 8.5 sort of thing), I'd say it is a waste of time because you'd having department load with projects, courses and internships season. Since you have a high CGPA, it essentially means that your core talent is good and can try for core placements. Not to discourage you from changing profile, but you have to work your ass-off for this, given the competition from circuital students. If you have sufficient time, for example sophomore year it is the right time to make a shift. Take up online courses such as Algozenith for SDE roles or coursera, YouTube courses from Krish Naik, StatQuest, etc. for Data Science. Learning and practicing DSA regularly and participating in online hackathons, weekly contests and help you with a fail-proof way to get through the online tests for internships and placements. Take up some self-projects from internet or your seniors or peers and learn the architecture, workflow, etc. for a good profile in your CV. Learn methods usually practiced in the tech industry by professionals to keep yourself updated. Every profile, either core or tech roles need hard-work. The pay is generally higher for tech roles given its demand in the market. However you are always open to explore core profile too, if you are passionate and have good academic record. Trying to transition in final year is not

18. How important is CGPA in the placement process?
A. CGPA is one of the most important aspects, right after your department. A high CGPA (above 8.5+), can naturally give you leverage to apply for more companies, because most of the companies, especially core companies have a CGPA criteria. If your CGPA is more than 9, Quant companies open for you, if you are from circuital department. High CGPA is strictly to bag "any" placement because some product companies do not put any criteria because product management is more about your skills and not your CGPA. If you are satti (CGPA 7-8), you might have a hard time with the number of companies opening for you. The median and safe zone is 8+ CGPA, try to maintain it. This importance of CGPA is not only evident in CDC placements but also off-campus when you apply through company portals.
