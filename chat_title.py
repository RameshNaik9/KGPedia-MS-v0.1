    Conversation: {query}
    Instructions:
    - The title should be concise and capture the essence of the user query
    - The title should not be too long
    - Make sure that is more relevant to the query and not the response because chat title is based on user query
    - If the user query is a simple greeting or a general query, you can return "General Conversation" as the title
    - Do not return any other string, except the title strictly. It is a serious matter, to keep the title clean and professional.
